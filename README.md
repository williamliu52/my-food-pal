# MyFoodPal

A SPA that makes logging your meals and viewing statistics on your meals easy and intuitive. I made this to better learn React and to replace MyFitnessPal, a popular meal tracking website, which I think has a poorly designed user interface.

You can view the application at https://my-food-pal.herokuapp.com/

**Note** This project is a WIP

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You'll need npm and NodeJS to run this application locally.

To start up the Node server and the React app use the `start` script. You should see the application open at `localhost:3000`.

```
npm run start
```

## Running the tests

Coming soon!
